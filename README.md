I have this on display to show the work that I completed during the 8 hour hackathon.  I completed all of the backend work including the SQL functions within the Character model.  There are many associations for the models and I created the functions so that we could display a Character's armor, weapons, and inventory.  

The majority of the CRUD actions are broken.
